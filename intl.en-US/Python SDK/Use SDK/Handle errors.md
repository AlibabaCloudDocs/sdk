# Handle errors {#concept_uzp_mjk_zdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Python SDK returns corresponding exceptions when an error occurs on the service side or the SDK side. These exceptions contain detailed error information, including the error code \(ErrCode\) Â and error message \(ErrMsg\).

You do not need to handle these returned errors. You only need to make corresponding modifications based on the error message.

-   `ServerException` is the exception returned by the corresponding Alibaba Cloud service.
-   `ClientException` is the exception returned by the Alibaba Cloud Python SDK.

For example, when the following error occurs, you have to modify the ID of the AccessKey according to the error message.

```
aliyunsdkcore.acs\_exception.exceptions.ServerException: HTTP Status: 404 Error:InvalidAccessKeyId.NotFound Specified access key is not found.
```

If you want to handle the client errors returned by the Alibaba Cloud Python SDK, refer to the following example to write your codes:

```
try:
    response = client.do_action_with_exception(request)
except ServerException as e:
    # You can add your own error handling logic here
    # For example, print the error message
    print e.get_http_status()
    print e.get_error_code()
    print e.get_error_msg()
```
